    "In this project, we will dive into implementing a basic calculator using Python. This project aims to consolidate your understanding of fundamental concepts like variables, conditional statements (if, elif, else), input/output functions, and arithmetic operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The calculator we're going to build will perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It will prompt the user to input two numbers and the desired operation, then display the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this project, you'll have created a simple but functional calculator that applies the foundational principles you've learned so far in your programming journey.\n",
    "\n",
    "here is the flow chart of our program.\n",
    "![flow chart](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/flowchart-200729062006/85/simple-calculator-flowchart-1-320.jpg?cb=1665676021)\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the steps for implementing the simple calculator program:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Accept User Input:**\n",
    "   - Prompt the user to enter two numbers.\n",
    "   - Ensure the input is formatted to remove extra spaces and handle cases (upper/lower).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Display Menu of Options:**\n",
    "   - Present a menu of operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, integer division, and exponentiation.\n",
    "   - Ask the user to input their desired operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Perform Valid Operation:**\n",
    "   - Check if the entered operation is valid (add, subtract, multiply, divide, integer division, exponent).\n",
    "   - If the operation is valid, proceed; otherwise, inform the user that the operation entered is not valid.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Perform Calculation:**\n",
    "   - Based on the chosen operation:\n",
    "     - Perform addition if the user chose 'add'.\n",
    "     - Perform subtraction if the user chose 'subtract'.\n",
    "     - Perform multiplication if the user chose 'multiply'.\n",
    "     - Perform division if the user chose 'divide'.\n",
    "     - Perform integer division if the user chose 'integer division'.\n",
    "     - Perform exponentiation if the user chose 'exponent'.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Display Result:**\n",
    "   - Show the calculated result of the chosen operation on the entered numbers.\n",
    "   - Output the result to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Handle Errors:**\n",
    "   - Ensure the program handles input errors gracefully, providing appropriate messages if the input format is incorrect or if an invalid operation is selected.\n",
    "\n",
    "These steps outline the process of building the calculator program, ensuring user input is validated, operations are performed based on the chosen operation, and the calculated result is displayed. Implementing these steps in Python will result in a functional simple calculator program."
